# Inventory-Management
We use SQL and JAVA SWING. The Inventory Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to optimize and automate inventory handling processes for manufacturing units. This project focuses on providing an efficient and intuitive platform for managing essential operational data, including stock levels, supplier and distributor information, customer complaints, and billing.

The system leverages a Swing-based GUI for a responsive and interactive user experience, combined with the reliability of SQL databases for storing and managing backend data. The goal of the system is to simplify the daily management tasks faced by manufacturing businesses, reduce errors, and improve productivity.

Key highlights of the system include:

A robust login and authentication module for secure access.
A well-organized dashboard that provides seamless navigation between different functionalities.
Versatile features like stock ordering, supplier and distributor management, product tracking, and complaint logging.
A billing module for generating transaction records.
Scalability to accommodate additional features and integrations in the future.
This system is ideal for small- to medium-scale manufacturing businesses looking for an affordable, user-friendly solution to handle their inventory and related operations effectively.
